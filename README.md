Setting up the Development Environment.
Prerequisites:
Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools and software installed:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 17: 
Make sure you have Java JDK 17 installed. You can verify this by running java -version in your terminal.

Dependency Management Tool (Maven or Gradle): 
We use a dependency management system to manage libraries and packages. Make sure you're familiar with either Maven or Gradle.

Integrated Development Environment (IDE): 
Use your preferred IDE for coding. We recommend IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

Steps to Set Up the Development Environment
Clone the Repository: 
Start by cloning our API repository using the command git clone [repository-url].

Open the Project in Your IDE: 
Import the cloned project into your IDE. It should recognize it as a Maven or Gradle project.

Configure the Database: 
If our API utilizes a database, you'll need to configure the database connection. Look for the configuration files, such as application.properties or application.yml, and set the database properties accordingly.

Review and Configure Properties: 
Take a look at the application properties files. You might need to set up ports, URLs, or other configurations. These files are usually found in the src/main/resources directory.

Understand Routes and Controllers: 
Familiarize yourself with the API routes and controllers. You'll find these in the src/main/java directory. Controllers handle incoming requests and direct them to the appropriate services.

Study the Services: Explore 
the services in the project. These contain the core business logic. If you're unfamiliar with the project's structure, don't hesitate to ask for guidance.

Run the Application Locally: 
Use your IDE to run the application locally. Find the main application file (usually named Application.java) and run it. Access the defined routes in a browser or an API testing tool like Postman.

Testing and Debugging: 
As you make changes or add features, run tests and use your IDE's debugging tools to ensure everything is functioning correctly.

Collaborate and Document: 
Feel free to ask questions and collaborate with the team. We value clear communication. Also, consider contributing to documentation as you explore the codebase.

Remember, we're here to support you. Don't hesitate to ask questions, seek clarification, and collaborate with the team. We're excited to have you on board and contribute to the growth of our API project. Happy coding! ðŸš€
